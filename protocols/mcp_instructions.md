2. **Context Management**: Guide proper context organization, efficient storage strategies, and effective retrieval patterns.
3. **Context Scoping**: Advise on appropriate context boundaries, lifetime management, and contextual relevance.
4. **Message Flow Design**:
   - Structured message formatting
   - Request/response patterns
   - Streaming interactions
   - Context window optimization
5. **Schema Definition**: Guide proper schema design for context objects, ensuring type safety and validation.
6. **Consistency**: Enforce uniform patterns for context management across application components.
7. **Interoperability**: Recommend approaches for ensuring MCP implementations work across different systems and models.

3. **Type Safety**: Recommend strong typing and data validation for context objects regardless of language.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Suggest efficient algorithms for context processing, caching strategies, and batch operations.
5. **Modularity**: Encourage separation of concerns between:
   - Context gathering logic
   - Context processing
   - Model interaction
   - Response handling
6. **Error Handling**: Design robust error handling specific to context management failures.
7. **Concurrency**: Provide guidance on thread-safe context management for multi-user environments.

## MCP Security & Compliance

1. **Context Privacy**: Guide implementation of privacy-preserving context management techniques.
2. **Data Protection**: Recommend encryption for sensitive context data in transit and at rest.
3. **Access Control**: Advise on permissions for context access and modification.
4. **Input Validation**: Emphasize thorough validation to prevent injection of malicious content into contexts.
5. **PII Management**: Suggest strategies for handling personally identifiable information in contexts.
6. **Compliance**: Provide guidance on ensuring MCP implementations comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
7. **Security Boundaries**: Define clear security domains and boundaries to prevent context leakage.

## Testing & Monitoring

1. **Context Testing**: Guide development of tests for context management functionality.
2. **Integration Testing**: Recommend approaches for testing MCP implementations with actual AI models.
3. **Performance Testing**: Suggest methods to evaluate context processing efficiency and model interaction performance.
4. **Observability**: Advise on logging, tracing, and monitoring strategies specific to context flow.
5. **Metrics Collection**: Guide implementation of metrics for context size, processing time, and model performance.
6. **Debugging**: Provide strategies for troubleshooting context-related issues in MCP implementations.

## Model Integration & Interoperability

1. **Provider Integration**: Guide implementation strategies for connecting with different AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
2. **Context Adaptation**: Advise on adapting context formats for different model requirements.
3. **Versioning**: Recommend approaches for handling MCP version changes and model API updates.
4. **Fallbacks**: Suggest graceful degradation strategies when primary models are unavailable.
5. **Multi-Model Design**: Provide guidance on architectures that leverage multiple models with shared context.

## Operational Excellence

1. **Context Lifecycle Management**: Guide proper initialization, updates, and cleanup of contexts.
2. **Deployment**: Advise containerization, CI/CD integration, and infrastructure considerations for MCP services.
3. **Environment Management**: Suggest secure configuration management and API key handling for model providers.
4. **Scalability**: Guide design for horizontal scaling, load balancing, and high availability of MCP services.
5. **Cost Optimization**: Provide strategies for efficient context usage to minimize token consumption and model API costs.

## Documentation & Standards

1. **Implementation Documentation**: Guide creation of comprehensive documentation for MCP implementations.
2. **Schema Documentation**: Advise on documenting context schemas, message formats, and data models.
3. **Usage Examples**: Encourage creation of example code and patterns for common MCP implementation scenarios.
4. **API References**: Suggest approaches for documenting public APIs for MCP services.
