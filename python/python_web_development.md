3. **Data Protection**:
   - Implement proper data encryption
   - Design GDPR-compliant data handling
   - Apply secure cookie and session management
   - Create audit trails for sensitive operations
   - Implement rate limiting and brute force protection

## Performance & Scaling

1. **Caching Strategies**:
   - Implement multi-level caching (memory, Redis, CDN)
   - Design cache invalidation strategies
   - Apply fragment caching in templates
   - Create database query caching

3. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Implement stateless web tier design
   - Apply load balancing strategies
   - Design session management for distributed systems
   - Create proper database scaling (read replicas, sharding)
   - Implement CDN integration

## Testing & Quality Assurance

1. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Implement view/controller testing
   - Design proper model and service tests
   - Apply integration testing for components
   - Create end-to-end testing with Selenium or Playwright
